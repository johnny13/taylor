# Taylor

**Taylor** is a WordPress starter theme built with Grunt, Sass, Bourbon, Neat and Hybrid Core. Taylor takes a mobile first approach and is fully responsive. It's meant to be used as a starting point, not a parent theme. It's flexible enough for you to turn it into anything you want.

Taylor uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to compile the SCSS files and run the stylesheets through [AutoPrefixr](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer) and [CSSComb](https://github.com/csscomb/grunt-csscomb). Itâ€™s also translation-ready and uses [grunt-wp-i18n](https://github.com/blazersix/grunt-wp-i18n) to make the .pot file.
