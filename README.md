# Taylor

**Taylor** is a WordPress starter theme built with Grunt, Sass, Bourbon, Neat and Hybrid Core. Taylor takes a mobile first approach and is fully responsive. It's meant to be used as a starting point, not a parent theme. It's flexible enough for you to turn it into anything you want.

Taylor uses [Grunt] to compile the SCSS files and run the stylesheets through [AutoPrefixr] and [CSSComb]. Itâ€™s also translation-ready and uses [grunt-wp-i18n] to make the .pot file.
